[0]: concatenated by 000***** 000***** 000***** (e.g., BLACK, which has r,g,b value 00000000 00000000 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (0/10) * (10/24) / (7/24) --> 0.000 * 0.417 / 0.292 = 0.000 

[56]: concatenated by 000***** 111***** 000***** (e.g., GREEN, which has r,g,b value 00000000 11111111 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (3/10) * (10/24) / (5/24) --> 0.300 * 0.417 / 0.208 = 0.600 

[448]: concatenated by 111***** 000***** 000***** (e.g., RED, which has r,g,b value 11111111 00000000 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (7/10) * (10/24) / (7/24) --> 0.700 * 0.417 / 0.292 = 1.000 

[511]: concatenated by 111***** 111***** 111***** (e.g., WHITE, which has r,g,b value 11111111 11111111 11111111)
probability that this color represents safe region is (0/10) * (10/24) / (5/24) --> 0.000 * 0.417 / 0.208 = 0.000
