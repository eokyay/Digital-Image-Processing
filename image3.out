[0]: concatenated by 000***** 000***** 000***** (e.g., BLACK, which has r,g,b value 00000000 00000000 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (0/4) * (4/12) / (3/12) --> 0.000 * 0.333 / 0.250 = 0.000 

[56]: concatenated by 000***** 111***** 000***** (e.g., GREEN, which has r,g,b value 00000000 11111111 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (0/4) * (4/12) / (1/12) --> 0.000 * 0.333 / 0.083 = 0.000 

[327]: OTHER
probability that this color represents safe region is (1/4) * (4/12) / (1/12) --> 0.250 * 0.333 / 0.083 = 1.000 

[448]: concatenated by 111***** 000***** 000***** (e.g., RED, which has r,g,b value 11111111 00000000 00000000)
probability that this color represents safe region is (3/4) * (4/12) / (3/12) --> 0.750 * 0.333 / 0.250 = 1.000
